      explanation: `What you're seeing above is Earth's LEO and MEO satellite field (Low & Medium Earth Orbit) restricted to a total count of 500. Further filtering can be done to show satellite types such as: Space Stations, Starlink Terminals, GPS Satellites, etc.
                   
                    Let's first discuss how the Earth is modeled in 3D space on a 2D screen. Using OpenGL, a sphere was built inside of a far larger sphere (the starmap) and was set as the center of the PyQt window. To rotate the entire earth-space fixture in 3D space, the mouse position at the click and release are recorded in (x,y,z) format. 2 vectors are formed from the origin and the angle & axis of rotation are calculated. Using Rodrigues' rotation formula, we are able to give OpenGL a rotation matrix to rotate the entire system in a way that corresponds to the mouse movement. 
                    
                    The satellite data is pulled from CelesTrak.org, website that publishes TLE's (Two-Line Elements) provided by the USSF & NORAD. A TLE is a compact data format that stores all of the orbital elements of a satellite (Inclination, Eccentricity, RAAN, ECI Ref. Frame, etc.). This file can be parsed using the SGP4 (Simplified General Perturbations) model, a model initially developed by the US Air Force. Using the Cysgp4 wrapper that wraps the C++ implementation of SGP4 (used for higher performance), all of the requested satellite TLE's were parsed and turned into objects storing velocity & position vectors.
                    
                    Each position vector is scaled down to suit the radius of the Earth in the simulation. This coordinate is plotted as a satellite in the simulation, and is a part of the rotation system described above. To prevent any excess requests to CelesTrak, TLEs are requested only every 12 hours. During the downtime, a numerical model is used to estimate the orbit of each satellite to show the live movement. In this case, I used Verlet Integration which is a numerical method that is really good at conserving energy, which keeps the satellites orbit from drifting. Using a Euler approximation for instance would have led to a build-up of positional inaccuracies over time.  
                    
                    Keep in mind, this simulation is made such that the coordinate system is fixed to Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinates. In simple terms, the coordinate system does not rotate with the earth (inertial), and the axes are fixed in space with the origin at the center of mass. This is typically the system you would want to use for spacecraft, as it simplifies the orbital mechanics by a great amount. 
                    
                    This live tracker can simulate tens of thousands of satellites at once, albeit with a reduced frame rate under high computational stress. I plan on fully migrating the visual engine to C++ instead of a Cython (C++/Python) implementation to increase performance.`
